Title: Voice Call Quality Analyzer
Description: Not all calls are smooth! Every now and then we have faced bad call quality and we are not sure if it’s a client, an AP, Network or the RF environment problem. The only thing we are sure is that packets flowing through network must have left some clues about call quality. The idea is to predict whether a particular call was good or bad looking at the packet’s parameters. It starts with taking packet captures on call endpoints for good and bad calls, evaluating different parameters including latencies and jitters and train ML models. At the end of the project, given a packet capture, model should be able to “predict” if the call was good or bad. Project can be extended to evaluate the quality of an ongoing call while packet flow through AP.
Project domain	Wireless Networking
Skills: Language - Any one of go/python/c, some understanding of ML

Title: Packet Analyzer
Description: A packet capture contains a lot of details which tells us about what was going on in the network (wired or wireless) for the duration of the packet capture. Idea is to create a tool to parse packet captures (.pcap files) and get information out of it to derive useful insights. For example, just by looking at the wireless packet capture, the tool can tell us about how many APs, clients were there in network and can take us through a particular client journey of successful/failed connection. Data will be presented in form of easy to digest visualizations, i.e., charts and tables. Project can be extended to find any anomalies in the network just by looking at the pcap.
Project domain	Wireless Networking
Skills: Must – Go/Python, Preferred – Node.js, Dockers, Mongodb 

Basic understanding of how client server architecture works, networking concepts
Expected learning (in bullet points)	•	A dashboard of insights on a per packet capture basis.
•	Landing page where it shows all packet captures uploaded with some metadata.

Title: Modeling and Simulation of Differential Pressure Based Pulsating Sensors for Various Applications 
Description: At  Innovative Sensors Section we have designed a high performance sensor based on capacitors and associated instrumentation towards applications in nuclear power plants. The Differential Pressure (DP) sensor based measurement systems are already developed and installed at plant sites in DAE Kalpakkam units. The performance evaluation and testing are currently being carried out with the feedbacks from experimental data analysis. To optimize the performance of these sensors we need to adopt various simulation techniques and mathematical modeling for evaluation of sensor parameters such as accuracy, precision, stability and resolution. 
	In the well type manometer based differential pressure sensor, multiple parallel plate capacitors are used for monitoring the variation in level caused by pressure difference. A mathematical model of the pressure sensor for various applications is to be carried out for evaluation of sensor performance. 
The work involved in this project: 
(includes finite element analysis using any FEA package)
1. Mathematical modeling and dynamic simulation of
a) Parallel plate capacitor assembly of different dimensions for different medium (need to arrive at the mathematical equation for capacitor assembly). FEA of the sensor electronics.
b) Well type manometer with a capacitor plate assembly (need to arrive at the mathematical equation for pressure versus level in the given manometer).
c) Coupling of capacitance and pressure of the developed DP sensor (need to arrive at the mathematical equation of the coupled problem in which there is a need to arrive at change in capacitance, which is due to change in level, which is due to change in pressure)
2. Error analysis for the above models
a) Dielectric change
b) Pressure correction
c) Temperature correction

Title: Development of FPGA/CPLD/ Microcontroller based 4 Channel DAQ Instrumentation for Slit System 
Description: The accelerators at Materials Science Group is used as a tool to pursue research in the areas of radiation damage of nuclear materials, basic science research in  nuclear, atomic, condensed matter and bio-environmental physics. Most of the experiments in these areas require a well focused, stable beam of a particular energy. The process of delivering such a beam is called accelerator tuning. The position and focusing parameters of the beam are optimised during beam tuning. In order to facilitate accurate alignment an focus of the ion beam, slits are used at low energy side and at end of the beam lines  in the accelerators. Typically the slits provide the position of the beam of charged particles. 

Existing instrumentation scheme involves mostly custom built imported units. In these type of slits,  current signals spanning over many orders (a few tenths of nA to tens of mA) are converted to voltage by an I to V converter amplifier. The voltage signals then are displayed on analog meters. Main disadvantages of such schemes are a) absence of data archival to enable storage of slit output waveforms for future reference. Data archival would be particularly useful for monitoring of the beam and for tuning  b) At any given time, display of position information with respect to 4  quadrants is required implying at least 4 meters are required for display c) Online measurement of beam position and position stability is not possible.

To overcome the above disadvantages and to serve as an import substitute, it is proposed to develop a FPGA/CPLD/Microcontroller based 4 channel DAQ instrumentation with USB/PCI interface for slit system. This involves design, fabrication and testing of a) various precision analog electronic circuits such as I-V preamps, ADC/DAC, ckts, b) FPGA/CPLD/Microcontroller based programmable instrumentation for  multichannel high speed digitsier, FIFO, USB/PCI interface c) motor controller, etc. The developed systems can be used in the 150kV/400kV accelerators. Additionally they will be gradually replacing the imported units presently being used in the 1.7MV accelerator.

At the end of the project, it is expected that the student would develop and acquire a very good working knowledge/expertise  of VHDL/Verilog programming, programmable instrumentation using Xilinx or Altera FPGAs, precision circuit design to handle pA-mA and uV-V level signals, circuit analysis and simulation using softwares like PSpice/TINA/LTSPICE,  GUI design and implementation using VB/C++/labVIEW, multilayer PCB design, Consolidation and analysis of data emanating from the project. Hence it is desirable for the student to have a very good familiarity and basic working knowledge in these areas. Based on the outcomes of the project, writing a suitable manuscript and submission to suitable peer reviewed journals are also expected. It is expected that there will be a good opportunity for the student to improve various soft skills including problem-solving, critical and creative thinking,  and communication.

Title: Optimal path control of a two-axis robotic arm for steam generator inspection system avoiding tube plug heads obstacle using Model Predictive Control (MPC
Description: 
Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) has 8 Steam Generators (SG) that use PFBR SG Inspection System (PSGIS) for the tube inspection. The inspection system has precision two-axis robotic arms to position the probe and cable pusher module to push 23 m length of the SG tubes internal for the Remote Field Eddy Current Inspection of the tubes for preventive maintenance of the SG module.  In the event of any tube degradation, the tubes are plugged at both ends where the plug heads may interact with the kinematic motion of the robotic arms end effector. A virtual circle around the plug head forms the restricted motion area to avoid any robotic arm end effecter interference with the plug heads. Now the tube inspection requires the motion from the start point to the endpoint which when passes through this restricted area, requires an optimal path to be planned for the motion and the inputs generated by the kinematic analysis as the kinematic constraints for the dynamic analysis. Robotic axes control falls under the (Multiple Input Multiple Output) MIMO System as the individual joint axes PDI controls do not suffice. Model Predictive Control implementation is proposed to be done to generate the sequence of each joint axes inputs in terms of position and velocities to move the end effecter in the optimal path negotiating the obstacle with stability. This project involves the kinematic, dynamic study of the 2 axes robotic arm with the path planning to avoid obstacle and the Model predictive Control (MPC) implementation. The project involves the PYTHON program development to implement MPC for the two-axis control for the inspection system

Title: Theoretical Studies on Leak Rate through the Crack on the Piping System
Description: Leak-Before-Break (LBB) requirement plays a vital role in demonstrating the structural integrity of the sodium-cooled Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) piping system. One critical parameter which governs the LBB design of a relatively low-pressure piping system is the crack size corresponds to detectable leakage (2CL).  Thus an accurate estimate of CL plays a vital role in achieving the robust piping design from LBB considerations. A recent literature review found limited studies on the leak rate assessment through fatigue crack on prototype sized pipe bend. Those studies are performed on a circumferential crack. The preferential direction for a crack to initiate in a typical FBR pipe bend is longitudinal.  Thus based on the available literature, it is planned to estimate leak rate through a longitudinal crack on a prototype sized pipe bend is planned in this project

Title: Simulation of Phase Change Material based Thermal Energy Storage System for Efficient Distributed Heating Applications
Description: 
To reduce dependence on fossils fuel, suitable storage and conversion of alternative forms of energy are envisaged. Thermal energy storage, using phase change materials, is a process of storing unused or waste heat that can be retrieved at a later stage on-demand. Practical implementation of such systems depends on numerous issues like energy supply and demand, physical distance and reversible thermal response of a very large quantity of phase change materials. 
The project envisages to develop a simulation model for thermal energy transportation for distributed heating systems. The idea is to implement transportation of heat, by vehicles, closer to the demand site, instead of distributing heat through very long pipes. The heat is then charged into containers that are integrated with phase change materials and heat exchangers.
Specific jobs:
1) Implementation of a simulation program for thermal energy storage and retrieval.
2) To numerically study the composite system dynamics on the basis of percentage content of phase change materials in the container, annual thermal demand and transportation distance.
3) Preliminary study material and codes will be provided. The candidate is required to further develop the system dynamics.

Title: Development of a GUI Desktop Application (in windows platform) for Feature Extraction and Multivariate Analysis from the Responses of a Sensor Array with Interactive Visualizations using R-shiny / Python package.
Description:  

Semiconducting metal oxide sensors are being used for their gas sensing capabilities due to changes in electrical resistance upon exposure to analyte gases/vapors. From a sensor array, signals (resistances) are collected continuously and different features like response time recovery time, response, integral area, response and recovery slopes etc. can be extracted. By considering the best features with maximum variance multivariate analysis algorithms like principal component analysis (PCA) or cluster analysis can be implemented to discriminate the analytes. Manually, it is a tedious process to derive these features from all the sensors in an array for all the analytes under test. Development of a graphical user interface based desktop application with the following features will be of great use for automated calculations.

Title: Design, Thermal Analysis and Fatigue Damage Assessment of Thermosyphon Evaporator (TSE) with Expansion Bellow on HX Shell
Description: 
The reprocessing of spent fuel generates large quantities aqueous wastes. The volume of waste is reduced by evaporating these large quantities in controlled manner by means of Thermosyphon Evaporators (TSE). The TSE is a liquid re-heater in which natural circulation of the boiling liquid is obtained by maintaining adequate liquid head. Low-pressure steam is used as heating medium in the evaporators. The TSE&apos;s consists of a re-boiler section, vapor drum for vapor- liquid separation and a down comer. The re-boiler is a Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger. Steam is admitted in shell side and process liquid on the tube side. 
Literature survey reveals the grand failure of TSE&apos;s at the tube to tubesheet joint of heat exchanger. One of the possible reasons of failure of TSEs is due to the thermal fatigue. This is because of the differential thermal expansion of the shell and tubes in the heat exchanger. Hence an expansion bellow needs to be introduced on the heat exchanger shell to increase its thermal flexibility, thermal fatigue analysis to be performed to assess its fatigue damage and design optimization of the same by iterations in numerical analysis for its structural integrity

Title: Warehouse planning and Logistics
Description: 1. Rivigo is solving logistics problems in India using technology. The FTL (Full Truck Load) team focuses on trucking and solve problems like driver&apos;s lifestyle and load transit time. One big problem in logistics is the driver&apos;s lifestyle, as drivers are usually away from home for about 20 to 30 days. Rivigo is solving this by the patented algorithm of relay and driver allocation. A truck moves through many pitstops during its journey from source to destination; at each pitstop, a new driver is allocated to drive the truck to the next pitstop and the previous driver is allocated a truck that returns him to his home pitstop. This ensures shorter duty hours and faster load movement as the truck doesn&apos;t have to wait for the driver&apos;s rest. Algorithms coordinate with drivers using a smartphone-based app. In FTL, we are working on many ground breaking projects: - Integration of IoT devices such as tyre pressure sensor, GPS, Fuel level sensor and AI cameras to detect drivers&apos; attention - Network balance algorithm, which controls the movement of the truck so that the availability of consignments, trucks, and drivers is balanced - Optimizing mileage based on data from fuel and pressure sensor and controlling fuel and air filling - Safety alerts based on Realtime data provided by AI camera and tyre temperature sensor - Direct driver behavior using performance and psychology-based incentive model - Probabilistic model for expenses approval 2. Warehouse planning: When moving shipments, the shipments are aggregated in a warehouse. The warehouse has a limited space, and given the amount of shipment it is important to plan the shipment location inside the warehouse. The optimal location improves warehouse utilisation as well as reduces the loading and unloading time.
